Hello,

I have been using Terraform for sometime but didn't got a chance to have formal training or reading on this interesting subject. So I got my hands on a nice book on this subject and have just finished it - "Terraform: Up and Running" by [Yevgeniy Brikman](http://www.ybrikman.com/). 

Good book for starters with extensive real world code examples. Though the examples are primarily focused around AWS but gives a very good understanding of Terraform. The author begins with very basic and in subsequnt chapters covers topics like creating instances, security groups, asgs. It also talk in detail on terraform structuring using modules etc.

Examples from this book can be found @ [https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code](https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code)
