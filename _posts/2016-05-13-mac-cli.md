Sometimes It is hard for me to remember all the different shortcuts that are available on command line in os x terminal so I am jotting them down here for quick references. Most of these commands should work on unix/linus as well.

1.CTRL + A --> Brings control to the beinging of shell.
2.> We loved with a love that was more than love
