title: OS X shell/cli quickies
---
Sometimes It is hard for me to remember different shortcuts that are available on cli/shell in os x terminal so I am jotting some most used commands and they should work on unix/linux as well.

- **CTRL + A** --> Brings control to the beinging of shell.
- **CTRL + E** --> Brings control to the end of shell.
- **CTRL + W** --> Delete words starting from end/right (backward word delete). So go to end and then use this 						 command.
- **CTRL + D** --> Forward delete character by character. ("Delete" button deletes from the right to left - So this is				reverse). Go to beinging of shell and then use this command.
- **CTRL + K** --> Deletes everything to its right. (Equal to ctrl + d except deletes in one go).
- **CTRL + U** --> Deletes everything to its left in one go.
- **CTRL + L** --> Equivalent of "clear".
- **CTRL + D** --> Logout of ssh session.
