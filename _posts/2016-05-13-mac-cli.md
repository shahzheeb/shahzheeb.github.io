title: Mac OS X CLI Shortcuts
---
Sometimes It is hard for me to remember different shortcuts that are available on cli/shell in os x terminal so I am jotting some most used commands and they should work on unix/linux as well.

1.	CTRL + A --> Brings control to the beinging of shell.
2.	CTRL + E --> Brings control to the end of shell.
3.	CTRL + W --> Delete words starting from end/right (backward word delete). So go to end and then use this 						 command.
4.	CTRL + D --> Forward delete character by character. ("Delete" button deletes from the right to left - so this is 				  reverse). Go to beinging of shell and then use this command.
5.	CTRL + K --> Deletes everything to its right. (Equal to ctrl + d except deletes in one go).
6.	CTRL + U --> Deletes everything to its left in one go.
