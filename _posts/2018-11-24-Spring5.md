Spring 5 has been the first major release since last few years - They have adopted the revolutionary changes happening in the JDK world, completely re-written Spring Core, Added support for Kotlin, Support for Reactive programming, Testing framework support for better fitment with Junit 5 etc. At the same time, they have discontinued the support for some legacy features like bean.factory.access, NativeJDBC & staticMock has been moved to other packages, Support for Hibernate 3/4 (now support Hibernate 5), MVC's Tiles 2 (now support Tiles 3). It has also removed support for some libraries like Velocity, Guava etc.



**JDK Support**:

Spring 5 is revamped to take advantage of Java 8 and above. The minimum JDK version that Spring 5 supports is Java 8. It has also upgrade to JEE 7 and therefore the minimums should be:
* Servlet 3.1
* JMS 2.0
* JPA 2.1


**WebFlux**
[Reactor](https://github.com/reactor/reactor) is the reactive library of choice for Spring WebFlux. It provides the Mono and Flux API types to work on data sequences of 0..1 (Mono) and 0..N (Flux) through a rich set of operators aligned with the ReactiveX vocabulary of operators. Reactor is a Reactive Streams library and, therefore, all of its operators support non-blocking back pressure. Reactor has a strong focus on server-side Java. It is developed in close collaboration with Spring.

WebFlux requires Reactor as a core dependency but it is interoperable with other reactive libraries via Reactive Streams.
