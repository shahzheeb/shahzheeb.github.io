I have been in IT industry for more than 15 years now and have worked on different platforms and domains. I truly believe Open Source is the RIGHT thing and everyone should be part of that community by contributing even if it is small PR - just be part of this revolution which is changing the world. Open source is nothing new - When humans first created fire or built an axe, they opened their knowledge to the world and therefore we excel !!!

I wish one day these major drug companies will open source their formulas so that others can take it further and we have a world where poor people have access to affordable and better healthcare.
